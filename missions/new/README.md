# A WordMixValidator contract

```
The function is defined as public and pure, which means it can be called externally and does not modify the contract's state.

The function takes two parameters: targetString, which is the string we want to emulate or match, and wordList, which is an array of strings.

The purpose of the validate function is to check different word combinations from the wordList to see if they can match the targetString.

The targetString is the desired string that we want to compare with the combinations from the wordList.

The wordList is an array of strings containing different words or phrases.
